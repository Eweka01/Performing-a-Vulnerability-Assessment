# Performing a Vulnerability Assessment

**Author**: Osamudiamen Eweka  
**Course**: CYB-605-Z2 Principles of Cybersecurity  
**Institution**: Utica University

## Overview

This lab simulates a penetration test and vulnerability assessment of a networked environment. The primary goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities and security weaknesses within the target network and to provide recommendations for remediation. The lab emphasizes the importance of understanding the scope of penetration testing, researching CVE entries, and analyzing vulnerabilities. It includes hands-on experience with tools like Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS to conduct scans, identify vulnerabilities, and generate reports.

## Objectives

- Simulate a real-world scenario where a penetration test and vulnerability assessment are conducted in a networked environment.
- Familiarize with tools such as Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS.
- Gain hands-on experience in identifying, analyzing vulnerabilities, and generating detailed reports.
- Understand the cyber kill chain and recommend mitigation strategies.

## Lab Setup

### Lab Environment Details

The lab environment consists of the following systems and tools:

- **Systems**:
  - vWorkstation (Windows: Server 2022)
  - Switch01 (Linux: Debian 11)
  - FileServer01 (FreeBSD)
  - pfSense-office (FreeBSD)
  - DomainController01 (Windows: Server 2019)
  - WebServer01 (Linux: Ubuntu 20)
  - AttackLinux01 (Linux: Kali)
  - GSM (Linux: Greenbone OS)

- **Software & Tools**:
  - Nmap/Zenmap
  - Nessus
  - OpenVAS/Greenbone Security Manager
  - Kali Linux distribution
  - Zenmap GUI

## Hands-On Demonstrations

### 1. Network Scanning with Zenmap
Participants used Zenmap to scan the local area network and identify hosts, services, and operating systems. Key tasks included:

- Performing a Ping scan and Service scan.
- Conducting an OS detection scan.
- Saving and documenting scan results.

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus
Participants conducted a vulnerability scan using Nessus. Key tasks included:

- Configuring and running a basic network scan.
- Reviewing and exporting scan results.
- Analyzing vulnerabilities and providing recommendations for remediation.

### 3. Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS
Participants conducted a comprehensive vulnerability assessment using OpenVAS and the Greenbone Security Manager (GSM) interface. Key tasks included:

- Configuring and launching a vulnerability scan.
- Analyzing scan results and vulnerabilities.
- Documenting findings and recommendations.

## Applied Learning

### 1. Penetration Testing with Nmap
Participants used Nmap to conduct network scans, identifying open ports and services. Tasks included:

- Running traceroute commands to map the network.
- Conducting default and advanced Nmap scans.
- Capturing scan results for documentation.

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS
Participants conducted a detailed vulnerability scan using OpenVAS, analyzing the results to identify security weaknesses and remediation strategies.

### 3. Penetration Test Reporting
Participants summarized their findings and prepared penetration test reports, including:

- Vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores.
- Remediation recommendations.
- Detailed analysis and conclusions based on scan results.

## Research and Analysis

### Key Findings
- **High Severity Vulnerability**: MVSOL MariaDB Weak Password (Severity: 9.0)
  - **Issue**: The MariaDB service is using a weak password.
  - **Recommendation**: Change the password to a more complex one.

- **High Severity Vulnerability**: VSFTPD Compromised Source Packages Backdoor Vulnerability (Severity: 7.5)
  - **Issue**: The vsftpd service is using compromised source packages.
  - **Recommendation**: Update vsftpd and remove compromised packages.

- **SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)**: Identified as a high-severity issue linked to the LDAP service on the domain controller.

## Conclusion

This lab provided valuable hands-on experience in performing vulnerability assessments using industry-standard tools like Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS. The exercises emphasized the importance of identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities to strengthen the security posture of networked environments. The lab also highlighted the importance of systematic documentation, vulnerability research, and remediation planning as key components of cybersecurity practices.
