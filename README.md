# Performing-a-Vulnerability-Assessment

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to simulate a real-world scenario where a penetration test and vulnerability assessment are conducted in a networked environment. The lab aims to familiarize students with the tools and techniques used in these activities, such as Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS, and to provide hands-on experience in identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities, as well as generating detailed reports based on the findings. By completing the lab, students will gain practical knowledge and skills in conducting security assessments, understanding the cyber kill chain, and recommending mitigation strategies for identified vulnerabilities.
